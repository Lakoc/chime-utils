‚úÖ Official data generation and data preparation scripts for CHiME-8 DASR. 

We provide a more convenient standalone interface for downloading the core and prepare the official CHiME-8 DASR data. <br> 
This year we also support automatic downloading of CHiME-6. <br>

‚ö†Ô∏è **NOTE** <br>
For in-depth details about CHiME-8 DASR data refer to [chimechallenge.org/current/task1/data](https://www.chimechallenge.org/current/task1/data). 

For any issue/bug/question with this package feel free to raise an issue here or reach us via the CHiME [![Slack][slack-badge]][slack-invite]

## Installation

I recommend making a fresh conda env before: 

`conda create --name chimeutils python=3.8` <br>
`conda activate chimeutils` 

You can install with: 

`python -m pip install .`

### Contribute

If you wish to contribute you can install with: 

`pip install -e .[dev]` <br>
`pip install pre-commit` <br>
`pre-commit install --install-hooks`

## Usage 

This package brings a new module: <br>
`from chime-utils import dgen, dprep, scoring, text_norm`

And related CLI commands: <br>
- `chime-utils dgen` <br>
    - generates and downloads CHiME-8 data.
- `chime-utils lhotse-prep` <br>
    - prepares CHiME-8 data lhotse manifests (which can be then converted to Kaldi and ESPNet compatible ones).
- `chime-utils speechbrain-prep` <br>
    - prepares CHiME-8 data Speechbrain-style JSON format.
- `chime-utils score` <br>
    - scripts used for official scoring.

Hereafter we describe each command/function in detail. 

## Data generation

### ‚ö° All DASR data in one go

You can generate all CHiME-8 DASR data in one go with: <br>
`chime-utils dgen dasr ./chime8_dasr ./download /path/to/mixer6 --part train,dev` 

This script will download CHiME-6, DiPCo and NOTSOFAR1 in `./download` <br>
Mixer 6 Speech instead has to be obtained through LDC. <br>
Refer to [chimechallenge.org/current/task1/data](https://www.chimechallenge.org/current/task1/data) on how to obtain Mixer 6 Speech.

You can check if the data has been successfully prepared with: <br>
`chime-utils dgen checksum ./chime8_dasr` 

### üê¢ Single Dataset Scripts

We also provide scripts for obtaining each core dataset independently if needed.

- CHiME-6
   -  `chime-utils dgen chime6 ./chime8_dasr /path/to/chime6 --part train,dev` 
   - It can also be downloaded automatically to `/path/to/dipco` using:
       - `chime-utils dgen chime6 ./chime8_dasr /path/to/chime6 --part dev --download` 
- DiPCo
    -  `chime-utils dgen dipco ./chime8_dasr /path/to/dipco --part dev` 
    - It can also be downloaded automatically to `/path/to/dipco` using:
      - `chime-utils dgen dipco ./chime8_dasr /path/to/dipco --part dev --download` 
- Mixer 6 Speech
    - `chime-utils dgen mixer6 ./chime8_dasr /path/to/mixer6 --part train_call,train_intv,dev`
 
## Data preparation

### üöÄ NeMo Official Baseline


### Other Toolkits

For convenience we also offer here data preparation scripts for different toolkits:
- [Kaldi](https://github.com/kaldi-asr/kaldi) and [K2/Icefall](https://github.com/k2-fsa/icefall) (with [lhotse](https://github.com/lhotse-speech/lhotse))
- [ESPNet](https://github.com/espnet/espne) (with [lhotse](https://github.com/lhotse-speech/lhotse))
- [SpeechBrain](https://github.com/speechbrain/speechbrain)

### K2/Icefall/Lhotse

You can prepare Lhotse manifests compatible with [K2/Icefall](https://github.com/k2-fsa/icefall) for all core datasets easily using:

- CHiME-6
    - e.g. to prepare manifests for far-field arrays and training, development partition: 
        - `chime-utils lhotse-prep chime6 ./chime8_dasr/chime6 ./sb_manifests/chime6 --dset-part train,dev --mic mdm`
    - you can also prepare manifests for on speakers close-talk mics: 
        - `chime-utils lhotse-prep chime6 ./chime8_dasr/chime6 ./sb_manifests/chime6 --dset-part train,dev --mic ihm`
- DiPCo
    - e.g. to prepare manifests for far-field arrays for development partition: 
        - `chime-utils speechbrain-prep dipco ./chime8_dasr/dipco ./sb_manifests/dipco --dset-part dev --mic mdm`
    - you can also prepare manifests for on speakers close-talk mics: 
        - `chime-utils speechbrain-prep dipco ./chime8_dasr/dipco ./sb_manifests/dipco --dset-part dev --mic ihm`
- Mixer 6 Speech
    - e.g. to prepare manifests for far-field arrays for training and development partitions: 
        - `chime-utils speechbrain-prep mixer6 ./chime8_dasr/mixer6 ./sb_manifests/mixer6 --dset-part train_call,train_intv,dev --mic mdm`
    - you can also prepare manifests for on speakers close-talk mics: 
        - `chime-utils speechbrain-prep mixer6 ./chime8_dasr/mixer6 ./sb_manifests/mixer6 --dset-part train_call,train_intv,dev --mic ihm`
- NOTSOFAR1

### ESPNet and Kaldi


### Speechbrain

You can prepare [Speechbrain](https://github.com/speechbrain/speechbrain) compatible JSON annotation (with multi-channel support !)
easily.

For example, for CHiME-6:
- e.g. to prepare manifests for far-field arrays and training, development partition: 
    - `chime-utils speechbrain-prep chime6 ./chime8_dasr/chime6 ./sb_manifests/chime6 --dset-part train,dev --mic mdm`
- you can also prepare manifests for on speakers close-talk mics: 
    - `chime-utils speechbrain-prep chime6 ./chime8_dasr/chime6 ./sb_manifests/chime6 --dset-part train,dev --mic ihm`
- or both together:
    - `chime-utils speechbrain-prep chime6 ./chime8_dasr/chime6 ./sb_manifests/chime6 --dset-part train,dev --mic all`

Similarly, you can use `chime-utils speechbrain-prep dipco`, `chime-utils speechbrain-prep mixer6` and `chime-utils speechbrain-prep notsofar1`
commands to prepare manifests for the other three scenarios. 

You can also use `chime-utils speechbrain-prep combine manifest1 manifest2 .... manifestN` to combine Speechbrain manifests together to train/validate 
on all scenarios simultaneously. 


## Scoring

Last but not least, we also provide scripts for scoring (same scripts as used by organizers to score submissions). <br>
To know more about scoring please head over the official [CHiME-8 Challenge website]().

### ASR 

In detail we provide scripts to compute common ASR metrics for long-form meeting scenarios. 
These scores are computed automatically through [Meeteval]() [1]. 

- tcpWER
- cpWER
- DA-WER 


You can also use 



### Diarization 


### Error Analysis 


As well as utils to convert CHiME-style long-form JSON annotation to other formats such as .ctm and Audacity compatible labels (.txt)
so that systems output can be more in-depth analyzed. 

- .ctm conversion
- .rttm conversion 

- Audacity labels
